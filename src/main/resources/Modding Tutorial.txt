Hello! So you want to modify the game Ultimate Football Manager?
Well, you're in luck. We have written this handy tutorial to make it easy!

Step 1:
	If you go further into the JAR file, into /data/base/, you will see template files.
	In these template files you can see exactly how we want to receive player and team information.

Step 2:
	Copy a template file to your desktop and fill it in according to our instructions.
	You can delete the stuff between <!-- stuff --> when you're done, those are comments and don't matter.

Step 3:
	Rename the file to the ID you gave the player or team.
	(If you are adding a team file, make sure all the players in it exist)

Step 4:
	Add a picture in the pictures folder with the same name as the team or player file.
	We would like the picture to be in the PNG format and be 160 by 160 pixels large.

Step 5:
	Drag your player file to /data/base/players
	Drag your team file to /data/base/teams

Step 6:
	???

Step 7: 
	Profit!
